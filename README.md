# ReactJS Apps

The mini apps I created while learning React.js. The apps can be run by navigating into he folder where the app is and running npm start.

## My Simple App

This is a simple app that displays information about me. 

## Counter App

This is an app that counts and hence, increments and decrements the value on the screen with the help of a button. It takes user input and updates the value that is supposed to be displayed.

## Conditional App

This app displays a value on the screen depending on a  condition. It checks for a condition and renders hings on the screen depending on whether it's true or false.

## User Auth Button App

This app has a button that either logs the user IN or OUT depending on the current state of the user.
